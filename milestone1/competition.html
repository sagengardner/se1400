        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <p>Our main competition InsideGym does a great job at engaging fans with quick updates and eye-catching social media content, which helps build excitement around gymnastics. However, the site often lacks depth, consistency, and credible sourcing in its coverage, which can leave readers searching for more reliable or thoughtful analysis. That’s where my college gymnastics news website stands out — I provide accurate reporting, in-depth features, and comprehensive coverage specifically focused on the college side of the sport, giving fans, athletes, and coaches the trustworthy and detailed insight they can’t always find elsewhere.</p>
