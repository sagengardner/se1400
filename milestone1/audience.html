        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The primary audience for my site will be college gymnastics fans, with most users living in the United States where NCAA gymnastics is popular. The main age range will be 16–30, as the site appeals to both current student-athletes and younger fans who follow college teams closely. While the audience will likely be majority female, given gymnastics’ strong appeal to women, it will also include male fans, athletes, and coaches. Other key demographics include college students, parents of gymnasts, and alumni who remain engaged with their university’s athletic programs.</p>
